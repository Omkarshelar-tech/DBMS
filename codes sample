Sure Ashish! Here's a simple MySQL query to create a table and insert a few rows. Let's say the table is about students:

### ✅ Create Table Query
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### ✅ Insert Some Sample Data
```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, course)
VALUES 
('Ashish Pardeshi', 19, 'Cybersecurity'),
('Shruti K.', 20, 'Computer Science'),
('Aditya Mhaismale', 19, 'Cybersecurity');
```

### ✅ Select the Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

This will show all students in the table. If you want to try something more advanced like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, or `WHERE` conditions, just say the word!
